# Starter Code - Frameworks & Intro to JS [Recreate Your Favorite Website Using Bootstrap & JavaScript]

This repository hosts code from the live lesson covering this module project. Feel free to use this as starter code for your project if you would like.

## How to use this repository:
You can download this repository as a zip file or you can clone it. Refer to the video recording for guidelines on cloning. (It will be at the end of the video.) Or, refer to your curriculum's guide on Git commands in terminal.

## How to finish this project:

First, make sure you refer to the Bootstrap documentation: https://getbootstrap.com/
Secondly, if you're using this starter code, it fullfills some of the project requirements for you. What remains to do is this:
- Add a table to your webpage.
- Add 2 JavaScript functions.
- Build out some sort of content for the additional pages in your website.
- Remember, you don't need any more than 3 pages (incuding the Home page) in your website.
- If you'd like, you can delete the additional pages I created. You only need 3, no more than that.
- You have total creative freedom with this project. So you can give it whatever theme you want. If you don't have a favorite website to recreate, that's fine. Just make it whatever you would like.
