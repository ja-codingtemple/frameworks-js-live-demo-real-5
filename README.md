## How to finish this project:

First, make sure you refer to the Bootstrap documentation: https://getbootstrap.com/
Secondly, if you're using this starter code, it fullfills some of the project requirements for you. What remains to do is this:
- Add a table to your webpage.
- Add 2 JavaScript functions.
- Build out some sort of content for the additional pages in your website.
- Remember, you don't need any more than 3 pages (incuding the Home page) in your website.
- If you'd like, you can delete the additional pages I created. You only need 3, no more than that.
- You have total creative freedom with this project. So you can give it whatever theme you want. If you don't have a favorite website to recreate, that's fine. Just make it whatever you would like.
